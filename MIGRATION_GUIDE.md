# GitHub Pages Migration Guide

## Issue: Switching from Branch Deployment to GitHub Actions

You're experiencing issues because you switched from:
- **Old**: "Deploy from a branch" → `gh-pages` branch
- **New**: "GitHub Actions" → Direct deployment

## Solution Steps

### 1. Repository Settings
Make sure your repository settings are correct:
- Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
- Set **Source** to **"GitHub Actions"** (not "Deploy from a branch")
- Save settings

### 2. Clean Up Old gh-pages Branch (Optional)
If you want to remove the old `gh-pages` branch:

```bash
# Delete local gh-pages branch
git branch -D gh-pages

# Delete remote gh-pages branch
git push origin --delete gh-pages
```

### 3. Updated Configuration
The workflow now uses:
- ✅ **Correct base URL**: `/portfolio/` (matches your repository name)
- ✅ **Proper permissions**: `pages: write`, `id-token: write`
- ✅ **Official GitHub Actions**: `actions/deploy-pages@v4`

### 4. Your Portfolio URL
Once deployed, your portfolio will be available at:
`https://engbahadin.github.io/portfolio/`

## Key Differences

### Old Method (Branch Deployment):
- Built locally or with separate CI
- Pushed to `gh-pages` branch
- GitHub Pages served from branch

### New Method (GitHub Actions):
- Built in GitHub Actions
- Deployed directly to GitHub Pages
- No `gh-pages` branch needed
- Better integration with GitHub ecosystem

## Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:
1. **Check repository name** - Make sure it matches the base URL (`/portfolio/`)
2. **Verify Pages settings** - Must be set to "GitHub Actions"
3. **Check Actions permissions** - Repository must allow GitHub Actions
4. **Clear browser cache** - Old CSS might be cached

The styling issue should be resolved with the updated SCSS configuration!
